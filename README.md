## My AI Content Generator

This AI plugin will allow WordPress authors to seamlessly integrate AI-powered content generation directly into the editor, streamlining their content creation workflow. Authors will be able to select and configure inference parameters of various AI models provided by [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/). Authors just need to hit a button and the plugin will automatically update the content editor and the excerpt with contents generated by AI. With quick content generation, the plugin should help authors be more productive.

I have written a comprehensive, step-by-step guide on how to build and use this plugin. You can find it on the community.aws: \
